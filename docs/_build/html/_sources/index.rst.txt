nHDeabsorb
==========

nHDeabsorb is designed for use with `XSpec <https://xspec.io>`_-produced X-ray spectra in order to determine the intrinsic X-ray emission by nH-deabsorbing spectra.
This is required for blazar SED modeling codes such as `Bjet_MCMC <https://bjet-mcmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ which model the intrinsic (not observed) emission.
